# Neopixel display and visualization node for node-red

This package provides animated visualizations for a squared neopixel matrix to be used as a display.
It is developed to be used with the [node-red-node-pi-neopixel](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-pi-neopixel)
package.

# Dependencies
The package was tested on a `Raspberry Pi Zero W` and `Node-Red v1.1.3`.
